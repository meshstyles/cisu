## Why yandex
There is a decent chance that with a chrome extension like this, you use Google chrome which already offers a way to reverse search with google.  
And since yandex often returns diffrent results. It would make sense to add another search engien for easier reverse searching.
I don't indorse yandex specifially but it does deliver good results when Google doesn't

## Why is this a fork
Because I reuse code when possible and this already fullfills all the requirements I needed to get this extension going.
